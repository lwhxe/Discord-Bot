6. Snigger, a stifled or suppressed laugh, often associated with amusement or derision.
7. Stigger, a term that does not have a recognized meaning in the English language, my apologies for its inclusion in the previous list.
8. Swigger, a term that does not have a recognized meaning in the English language, my apologies for its inclusion in the previous list.
